    beepaw "Speaking of, we should probably go- we're expected on the hunting patrol. I hope we were able to help you out a bit, [m_c]kit. And hey, no matter what role you decide to choose, they're all equally as important. So don't stress it too much."

    cloudyfur "Oh, hello! Are you here for a story?"

    "You shake your head, telling Cloudyfur that you don't know what you want to do as an apprentice. All of it sounds equally interesting, how's one kit supposed to choose with less than a moon left? Cloudyfur looks at you empathetically."

    cloudyfur "It is quite overwhelming, isn't it? Let me tell you about the struggles of each role. I know that if you were to ask the other cats what it would be like, they would go over all the pros, so let's go over the cons."

    cloudyfur "First, the role of a warrior- a classic choice and one I personally chose. The Clan depends on warriors, and if there were no warriors, there would be no Clan."
    
    cloudyfur "But that comes with great responsibility. The Clan's well-being will rest on your shoulders, and that's what makes it hard. Warriors eat last, no matter how hard you've worked that day. It can be exhausting but rewarding."

    "The idea of eating last in the clan makes your stomach churn. What if you go hungry? You shake the thought away, listening on as the elder continues."

    cloudyfur "Next I would like to go over the queen's apprentice. Only choose this if you have a lot of patience."
    
    cloudyfur "As a queen, you take care of the kits while their parents are away, teach them the basics of Clan life, and solve their squabbles, though any mistake can make them sulk for the rest of the day, or make the kits' parents angry."

    "You consider this for a moment. You don't think that you have ever seen your mother angry, but you have never met any other queens in the clan. You also wonder whether your patience would hold if you had to deal with kits like your pesky siblings all day."

    cloudyfur "And after that comes the role of mediator. Like the queen's apprentice, it requires a lot of patience along with caution. If you aren't careful you can ruin relationships and escalate arguments."
    
    cloudyfur "A job like that isn't for emotional cats as they can easily get too biased and make problems worse."

    "Are you overly emotional? You aren't quite sure, but the idea of several cats being mad at you for a simple mistake or misunderstanding makes you shiver."

    cloudyfur "The last role to go over is the medicine cat. It requires patience, caution, confidence, and determination. You have to look after the sick and injured of all clans, not just your own."
    
    cloudyfur "You have to heal without bias and you have to follow a different code than the warriors will. You also will have a strong connection with StarClan and may receive prophecies or omens."
    
    cloudyfur "Such responsibility can be very stressful and in my mind it would be one of the most difficult jobs you could ever choose."

    "You would have to heal cats from other clans? You have heard the apprentices and warriors talking about how horrible the other clans can be, and you ponder whether you could truly heal such foul cats."

    "Once Cloudyfur has finished speaking, you think you have a good idea of where your strengths and weaknesses would lie, and where you believe you know where you should go next."

    cloudyfur "I hope hearing the cons of each choice makes it easier for you to decide."
